# You have a F2 population of a plant species 
# (which is a diploid) resulted from a cross 
# between a plant with red flowers and a plant 
# with white flowers. You hypothesized that: the
# flower color is controlled by a single gene; 
# each of the parents is homozygous for the gene;
# the red allele is dominant over the white allele. 
# When you scored 20 F2 plants, what is the probability 
# to have the number of plants with white flowers 
# is 2 or fewer? Upload a file that includes all the 
# activities in your R session, so I can see how you did it.
