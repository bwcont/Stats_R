# Make a plot that demonstrates that a Poisson 
# distribution is a good approximation of a binomial 
# distribution when n >> 0 and p << 1. To do this, 
# choose an appropriate set of n and p values, like slide 
# 51 of Ppt180919. (But note that both distributions in 
# this assignment are discrete distributions.) 
# Make a single file that contains: all the 'code' you used for 
# this (it is fine to copy all the related from the console); 
# the plot you made as a pasted picture (5 points); including 
# a legend + plot title + labeled axes that were inserted into
# your graphic using R (2 points); and an accompanying text 
# explanation of why this plot demonstrates that a Poisson 
# distribution is a good approximation of a binomial distribution
# when n >> 0 and p << 1. Make the explanation understandable to 
# people who only see your plot and explanation - assume that those
# people do not see your R scripts (3 points).
